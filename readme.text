🚀 Building a Powerful Selenium TestNG Hybrid Framework for UI Automation 🖥️



Excited to share my work on a comprehensive Selenium TestNG Hybrid Framework designed for scalable and efficient UI testing. Here’s a look at the key components that make it effective and maintainable:



1. TestNG: 🧪 Provides a solid structure for test execution, along with powerful annotations, dependency control, and parallel execution capabilities.



2. Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory: 🧩 Utilizes the POM design pattern for cleaner and modular test scripts, enhancing readability and maintainability.



3. Maven for Dependency Management: 📦 Manages dependencies and makes project setup seamless, while supporting CI/CD integration with Jenkins.



4. Global Properties (`global.properties`): 🌐 Centralizes configuration settings for easy switching between environments (e.g., base URLs, credentials).



5. JSON Data to List of HashMap: 📋 Implements data-driven testing by mapping JSON data into a `List<HashMap>` using `ObjectMapper`, allowing efficient parameterized test scenarios.



6. Abstract & Base Class: 🔄 Facilitates method reusability for common actions, such as navigation, logging, and element handling.



7. Extent Reports: 📊 Generates in-depth HTML reports with detailed logging and screenshots, providing better visibility into test execution results.



8. TestNG Listeners & IRetryAnalyzer: 🔄 Uses listeners for enhanced logging, reporting, and failure handling, while `IRetryAnalyzer` manages flaky tests with automatic retries.



9. TestNG XML File: 📄 Orchestrates test execution, allowing control over test suites, groups, and parallel execution.



10. Jenkins Integration: 🛠️ Automates test execution with CI/CD, enabling continuous feedback and efficient reporting.




🌟 This framework is designed to:

- Improve scalability and maintainability for complex test suites.

- Centralize data and configuration for better test management.

- Enhance reporting and resilience with retry mechanisms for flaky tests.



Building this kind of modular and reusable framework has been an exciting challenge, and I'm eager to explore further optimizations in automation!💡
